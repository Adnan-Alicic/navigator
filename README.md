## Description:
https://www.navigator.ba/#/categories is an application that aims to make it easier to navigate and find various types of objects. Smoke tests should cover the basic flow that a visitor to a page should have, i.e. the search for a specific type of object, selecting one of the offered ones, and viewing the pin at its location. Cypress.js was used for automatic testing of smoke tests, and the page object model was also taken into account for possible additional tests, etc.
